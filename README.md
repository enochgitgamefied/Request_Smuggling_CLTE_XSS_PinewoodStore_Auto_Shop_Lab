# 🔥 Realistic demo of Chaining Vulnerabilities by bad actors to compromise accounts and systems  

## Request Smuggling + XSS Full Exploitation Demo

Welcome to the **Request Smuggling CL.TE + XSS PinewoodStore Auto Shop Lab** —
a hands-on Docker-based lab designed to show how **chaining multiple web vulnerabilities** can escalate into full **account takeover and complete system compromise**.

In this lab, you will exploit:

* ✅ HTTP **Request Smuggling (CL.TE variant)**
* ✅ A reflected **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw
* ✅ Backend **session handling and cookie trust**

…and **chain them together** to steal other users’ session cookies, even without their interaction — achieving **account compromise** and demonstrating how small bugs can combine into devastating attacks.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ What You’ll Learn and Demo

In this advanced lab, you’ll walk through:

* Understanding the **Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding mismatch (CL.TE)** request smuggling technique
* Using crafted smuggled requests to bypass frontend/backend sync
* Smuggling a reflected XSS payload inside an innocent-looking request
* Escalating the reflected XSS into an **effective stored XSS** by forcing it to trigger on any authenticated user — even if they never visit the vulnerable page
* Stealing session cookies, hijacking accounts, and demonstrating how the entire system can be compromised by chaining these bugs

This lab gives you a **full attack demo** — from theoretical understanding to live exploitation.

## 🔒 Backend Setup Highlights

This lab includes:

* A real backend **user authentication system** with cookies
* A **reflected XSS flaw** that’s normally hard to exploit without user action
* A vulnerability chain that lets you **turn reflected XSS into stored-like XSS**, impacting any logged-in user, even if they never visit the vulnerable page

✅ Exploiting this chain shows how attackers can **steal cookies and compromise accounts** at scale
✅ The lab mimics real-world misconfigurations seen in production environments

## 🧩 Understanding the Vulnerabilities

Before diving into the full chained attack, let’s break down the two core vulnerabilities on their own:

---


---

## 🚨 **What Is HTTP Request Smuggling?**

HTTP Request Smuggling is a **web attack technique** that takes advantage of **inconsistent parsing** between:
✅ a front-end server (like a reverse proxy, load balancer, or CDN)
✅ and a back-end server (like the application or origin server).

It lets attackers **smuggle** hidden HTTP requests through the front-end,
so the back-end processes something the front-end never intended.

---

## 🏗 **Basic Structure**

In a normal setup:

```
[ Attacker ] → [ Front-End Proxy ] → [ Back-End Server ]
```

The front-end **parses and forwards** requests to the back-end.

But **if they disagree** on where one request ends and the next begins,
an attacker can **confuse them**.

That’s where the smuggling happens.

---

## 🔑 **Where’s the Confusion?**

The HTTP spec allows two ways to signal where a request body ends:

1️⃣ `Content-Length` header →
says how many **bytes** are in the body.

2️⃣ `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` →
body comes in **chunks** with sizes.

---

### ⚠️ When Front-End ≠ Back-End

If:

* The front-end trusts `Content-Length`,
  but the back-end trusts `Transfer-Encoding`

OR

* One ignores one header while the other uses it,

then the two servers **split the request differently**.

This lets the attacker:
✅ Hide part of one request inside another.
✅ Send multiple requests inside a single packet.
✅ Trick the back-end into **executing something the front-end didn’t see**.

---

## 🧨 **Common Smuggling Variants**

| Variant | Meaning                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CL.TE   | Front-end uses Content-Length, back-end uses Transfer-Encoding |
| TE.CL   | Front-end uses Transfer-Encoding, back-end uses Content-Length |
| TE.TE   | Different Transfer-Encoding handling differences               |

---

## 🔓 **What Can an Attacker Do?**

With successful request smuggling, attackers can:
✅ Bypass security controls on the front-end.
✅ Inject **ghost requests** to the back-end.
✅ Hijack other users’ requests (session hijacking).
✅ Poison HTTP caches.
✅ Deliver stored XSS or CSRF payloads.
✅ Chain attacks to escalate to full **system compromise**.

---

## 🔧 **Example Attack**

Imagine this:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
...
```

To the **front-end**:

* Content-Length → body is `0`

To the **back-end**:

* Transfer-Encoding → **hidden** second request smuggled in!

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ **How Does the Smuggled Request Reach the Back-End?**

* The front-end forwards everything (even junk) downstream.
* The back-end **parses new requests** out of the incoming stream.
* Attacker injects:

  * Additional HTTP methods (like `GET /admin`)
  * Malicious payloads
  * Modified headers or cookies

---

## 📦 **Chunked Encoding Example**

With chunked encoding:

```
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

4\r\n
Wiki\r\n
6\r\n
pedia \r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

This sends:

* `4` hex → 4 bytes → `Wiki`
* `6` hex → 6 bytes → `pedia `
* `0` → end of body

If the front-end **doesn’t parse this right**, the attacker can smuggle chunks that the back-end thinks are **new requests**.

---

## 🔒 **Why Is It So Dangerous?**

* Request smuggling **attacks the server-to-server layer**, not the normal client-server flow.
* It **bypasses web firewalls, proxies, and security tools**.
* It can target **specific victims** by hijacking their connections.
* It’s notoriously **hard to detect and patch**.
* 

Certainly! Here are the two notes you asked for — the first covering **XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting), and the second covering **Request Smuggling combined with XSS** to escalate to **stored XSS via response queue poisoning**.

---

### 🛡️ **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

**XSS** is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject **malicious scripts** (usually JavaScript) into pages viewed by other users. It's often caused by improper input sanitization and appears in three forms:

* **Reflected XSS**: The payload is part of the request and reflected in the response (e.g., in a search result).
* **Stored XSS**: The payload is saved on the server (e.g., in a comment) and served to all users later.
* **DOM-based XSS**: The browser executes untrusted scripts based on insecure client-side code.

**Impact**:

* Session hijacking
* Credential theft
* Phishing
* Defacing pages
* Worm propagation across user sessions

---

### 🔥 **Request Smuggling + XSS (Stored XSS via Queue Poisoning)**

This is an advanced, blended attack.

In **Request Smuggling**, an attacker sends a crafted HTTP request that **injects an extra (hidden) request** into the request queue seen only by the back-end server. If this injected request includes **malicious JavaScript**, and the next legitimate user’s request gets **partially parsed into the injected payload**, the backend may respond with:

> 🔁 Part of the attacker’s injected content as the body of the user’s response

This creates a **Stored-like XSS**, even if no database is involved.

### 🧠 Here's how it plays out:

1. Attacker sends:

   ```
   POST / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   Content-Length: 50
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   0

   GET /somepage HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ...

   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
2. Front-end sees a short, normal request and forwards it.
3. Back-end sees a **second smuggled GET** and queues it.
4. The next user's request gets "paired" with this back-end response.
5. That user **receives and executes the attacker’s JavaScript**.

This is sometimes called:

> **"Reflected-to-Stored XSS" via Response Queue Poisoning**

**Impact**: It's stealthy and requires no persistent storage. It also bypasses XSS filters that only inspect normal request parameters.
