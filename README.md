# 🔥 Realistic demo of Chaining Vulnerabilities by bad actors to compromise accounts and systems  

## Request Smuggling + XSS Full Exploitation Demo

Welcome to the **Request Smuggling CL.TE + XSS PinewoodStore Auto Shop Lab** —
a hands-on Docker-based lab designed to show how **chaining multiple web vulnerabilities** can escalate into full **account takeover and complete system compromise**.

In this lab, you will exploit:

* ✅ HTTP **Request Smuggling (CL.TE variant)**
* ✅ A reflected **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw
* ✅ Backend **session handling and cookie trust**

…and **chain them together** to steal other users’ session cookies, even without their interaction — achieving **account compromise** and demonstrating how small bugs can combine into devastating attacks.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ What You’ll Learn and Demo

In this advanced lab, you’ll walk through:

* Understanding the **Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding mismatch (CL.TE)** request smuggling technique
* Using crafted smuggled requests to bypass frontend/backend sync
* Smuggling a reflected XSS payload inside an innocent-looking request
* Escalating the reflected XSS into an **effective stored XSS** by forcing it to trigger on any authenticated user — even if they never visit the vulnerable page
* Stealing session cookies, hijacking accounts, and demonstrating how the entire system can be compromised by chaining these bugs

This lab gives you a **full attack demo** — from theoretical understanding to live exploitation.

## 🧩 Understanding the Vulnerabilities

Before diving into the full chained attack, let’s break down the two core vulnerabilities on their own:

---

### 🔍 **1️⃣ HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.TE)**

**What is it?**
HTTP request smuggling exploits desynchronization between a frontend (proxy/load balancer) and backend (web server) by crafting a request that is interpreted **differently** by each.

Specifically, the CL.TE (Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding) variant uses:

* A `Content-Length` header for one parser
* A `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header for the other

This allows attackers to:
✅ Inject hidden (smuggled) requests
✅ Bypass security filters
✅ Poison HTTP request queues
✅ Trigger unexpected backend behavior

**Standalone impact:**

* Inject fake requests that affect other users’ responses
* Hijack or disrupt other users’ sessions
* Potentially gain access to admin-only or protected areas

---
Great question! Let me break it down clearly.

When you request a page like Wikipedia using a tool like **Burp Suite**, you’re working at the **HTTP layer**. By default, Wikipedia (and most major sites) uses **chunked transfer encoding** when the server sends **responses**, not when clients send requests.

Let’s unpack this:

---

### 🔍 What is Chunked Transfer Encoding?

Chunked transfer encoding is part of **HTTP/1.1**.
It allows the server to **send a response in parts (“chunks”)** without knowing the full content length up front.

Instead of sending:

```
Content-Length: 12345
```

the server sends:

```
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

Then the body looks like:

```
<length of chunk in hex>\r\n
<data>\r\n
<length of next chunk in hex>\r\n
<data>\r\n
...
0\r\n
\r\n
```

For example:

```
4\r\n
Wiki\r\n
6\r\n
pedia \r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

---
Let’s break it down line by line — this is how **HTTP chunked transfer encoding** works.

---

### 📦 1️⃣ → `4\r\n`

This line says:

* The **length of the next chunk** is `4` (hexadecimal), which equals `4` in decimal.
* This tells the server: “Expect **4 bytes** of data next.”

---

### 📄 2️⃣ → `Wiki\r\n`

This is the **4-byte data**:

* `Wiki` (the actual content)
* Followed by `\r\n` (carriage return + line feed) to mark the end of the chunk’s data.

---

### 📦 3️⃣ → `6\r\n`

This line says:

* The **length of the next chunk** is `6` (hexadecimal), which equals `6` in decimal.
* This signals: “Expect **6 bytes** of data next.”

---

### 📄 4️⃣ → `pedia \r\n`

This is the **6-byte data**:

* `pedia ` (note the space at the end!)
* Followed by `\r\n` to end this chunk.

---

### 📦 5️⃣ → `0\r\n`

This marks the **last chunk**:

* `0` means “no more data” (end of chunks).
* Followed by `\r\n` to close the chunks section.

---

### ✅ Final → `\r\n`

After the terminating `0` chunk, there’s a **final CRLF** that signals:

* End of the **entire HTTP message** body.

---

### 🔗 Summary

So together, this transmits:

```
4\r\n
Wiki\r\n
6\r\n
pedia \r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

→ which the server interprets as:
`Wiki` + `pedia ` = `Wikipedia ` (space included)

This mechanism allows servers to **stream content** dynamically without knowing the total size up front.



Great observation! Let me clarify this carefully.

---

### 🔍 **Why You Don’t See Chunking in the GET Request**

When you send a **GET request** (or **any HTTP request**) from Burp Repeater or Proxy to Wikipedia or another server,
the **request** you send **does not use chunked encoding** — it’s usually a simple request like:

```
GET /wiki/Main_Page HTTP/1.1
Host: en.wikipedia.org
User-Agent: ...
```

That’s it.
✅ It has **no** `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.
✅ It usually has **no body** (since GET requests normally don’t send one).
✅ It’s straightforward.

---

### 🏗 **Where Does Chunked Transfer Encoding Appear?**

It appears in the **HTTP response from the server to you** — **not** in your request.

Example response (simplified):

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

4\r\n
Wiki\r\n
6\r\n
pedia \r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

✅ The server uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` **so it can stream parts of the response**
without calculating the full `Content-Length` beforehand.

---

### 🔧 **How Do You See This in Burp?**

✅ Send a **normal GET request** in Burp.
✅ Go to the **Response** tab.
✅ Look at the **Raw** or **Hex** view.
✅ If the server used chunked encoding, you’ll see the chunks appear **in the response body** —
BUT Burp’s **Pretty** view will often **reconstruct** the content, hiding the chunks from you for convenience.

You only see the raw chunks if you switch to **Raw** or **Hex** view.

---

### ⚙️ **What About Chunked Requests?**

While **responses** often use chunked encoding,
**requests** from clients **rarely** do (unless you craft them deliberately for testing or smuggling attacks).

For example, you can force a crafted POST request like:

```
POST /submit HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

4\r\n
Wiki\r\n
6\r\n
pedia \r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

…but this is something **attackers or researchers craft by hand**,
not something Wikipedia expects or that browsers generate by default.

---

### ✅ Summary

| **Direction**                     | **Uses Chunked Encoding?**                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GET request (client → server)     | ❌ No, unless specially crafted for testing |
| POST request (client → server)    | ❌ No, unless manually crafted              |
| Server response (server → client) | ✅ Often, to stream content                 |

---



### 🚀 How Is This Relevant to Testing?

For **request smuggling**, you’re often crafting **requests** that:

* Combine **Content-Length** + **Transfer-Encoding** headers (CL.TE or TE.CL mismatches).
* Smuggle hidden payloads into how the frontend/backend parse chunks.

But for **Wikipedia**, you generally observe **chunking on the response side**,
unless you manually craft a **chunked POST request** to test upstream servers.




### 🔍 **2️⃣ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

**What is it?**
Reflected XSS occurs when user-supplied input (like a URL parameter) is echoed back in a page **without proper escaping or validation** — allowing attackers to inject JavaScript.

This enables:
✅ Running arbitrary JavaScript in a victim’s browser
✅ Stealing session cookies
✅ Performing actions on behalf of the victim (CSRF-like)
✅ Delivering phishing payloads

**Standalone impact:**

* Normally, reflected XSS **requires tricking a user** into clicking a crafted link
* Attackers can only target victims who actively visit a malicious link or page

---

## 🔗 **Chaining: Request Smuggling + Reflected XSS**

Individually, each vulnerability has limitations:

* Request smuggling: great for backend manipulation but limited by what you can *inject*
* Reflected XSS: powerful in the browser but normally requires **user interaction**

But when **combined**, they become much more dangerous.

In this lab:

* You use request smuggling to **inject an XSS payload** into another user’s response
* This effectively turns the reflected XSS into a **stored-like XSS**, requiring **no user interaction**
* Any authenticated user with a valid session cookie, even if they **never visit the vulnerable page**, can be silently exploited

---

## 🚨 Final Impact

✅ **Steal active session cookies** from authenticated users
✅ Compromise user accounts without phishing or tricking users
✅ Escalate control to admin or system-wide compromise
✅ Demonstrate a real-world attack chain seen in advanced web exploitation scenarios

## ⚠️ Important

* This lab is **for educational and ethical hacking practice only**
* Do **NOT** apply these techniques to systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test
* Make sure your system has Docker installed and sufficient resources
